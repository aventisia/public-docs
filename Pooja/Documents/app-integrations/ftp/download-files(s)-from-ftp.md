Letâ€™s say you want to download all `.csv` files from your FTP into `D:\Reports\`:

- **FTP connection**: `MyFTPConnection`
- **Download into folder**: `D:\Reports\`
- **File(s) to download**: `*.csv`
- **Transfer type**: `Binary`

This setup will fetch every `.csv` file from the FTP and replace any existing ones in the folder.
