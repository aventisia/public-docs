## Example Configuration

Letâ€™s say you want to upload all `.csv` files from `D:\Exports\` to the `/data/monthly/` folder on your FTP server:

- **FTP connection**: `MySecureFTP`
- **File(s) to upload**: `D:\Exports\*.csv`
- **RemoteLocation**: `/data/monthly/`
- **Transfer type**: `ASCII`
- **If file exists**: `Rename`

This configuration will upload all matching files without overwriting existing ones, ensuring your previous data stays intact.
