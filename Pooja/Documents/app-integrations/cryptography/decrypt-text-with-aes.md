# Decrypt Text with AES

## Description

This screenshot demonstrates an interface for decrypting text that has been encrypted using the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** algorithm. Users can input the encrypted text, specify a decryption key, and configure advanced settings such as encoding, initialization vector (IV), and salt.
