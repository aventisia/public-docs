## Configuration

### Hash Algorithm

- **Option**: Select the hashing algorithm (e.g., HMAC-SHA256).

### Encoding

- **Option**: Select the encoding type (e.g., Unicode).

### File to Hash

- **Field**: Choose the file you want to hash.

### Hash Key

- **Field**: Provide the hash key used for the HMAC algorithm.
