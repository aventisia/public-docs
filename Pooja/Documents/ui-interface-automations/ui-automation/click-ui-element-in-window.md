# Click UI Element in Window

## Description

The "Click UI Element in Window" tool allows users to simulate a click on a specified UI element within a window. Users can select the click type (e.g., left click) and optionally simulate the mouse cursor movement prior to clicking. Changes can be saved to execute the action or canceled to discard them. Note that this action does not require the UI element's screen to be in the foreground and may not be applicable to every UI element.
