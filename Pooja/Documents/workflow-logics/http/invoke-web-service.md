# **Invoke Web Service**

## **Description**

The **Invoke Web Service** node is a key component in workflow automation that allows seamless interaction with external web services via HTTP requests. It enables workflows to fetch, send, or process data from APIs or remote servers.

## **Functionality**

The **Invoke Web Service** node is used to:

- Connect with external APIs and web services.
- Perform various HTTP request methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).
- Handle different data formats such as `JSON` and `XML`.

---

## **Key Configuration Options**

When setting up this node, the following parameters must be defined:

### **URL (Required)**

- Specifies the web service endpoint to interact with.
- Example: `https://dummy.com`

### **Method (Required)**

- Defines the HTTP request type.
- Options include:
- **GET** → Retrieves data from the server.
- **POST** → Sends data to the server and fetches a response.
- **PUT** → Updates existing data on the server.
- **DELETE** → Removes data from the server.

### **Accept Header**

- Specifies the response format expected from the server.
- Example: `application/xml` (requests XML response).
- Other options: `application/json`, `text/plain`, etc.

### **Content-Type**

- Defines the format of data being sent to the server.
- Example: `application/xml` (indicates XML request payload).
- Other options: `application/json`, `multipart/form-data`, etc.

### **Custom Headers**

- Allows the inclusion of additional HTTP headers.
- Used for authentication, authorization, or custom API requirements.

---

## **Use Cases**

**API Integration** → Fetch or update data from third-party services.  
**Data Synchronization** → Connect workflows with external databases or applications.  
**Automated Reports** → Retrieve structured XML or JSON responses for analysis.  
**Cloud Interactions** → Send or receive data from cloud-based platforms.  

---

## **Example Scenario**

**Scenario:** A workflow needs to fetch the latest weather information from an external API.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Invoke Web Service Node** makes a `GET` request to `https://weatherapi.com/latest`.
2. The response is returned in **XML format**.
3. A **Parser Node** extracts key weather details.
4. The extracted information is **stored in a variable** and used in decision-making.
5. If adverse weather conditions are detected, a **Notification Node** sends an alert.

---

## **Benefits of Using This Node**

**Seamlessly integrates workflows with external APIs.**  
**Supports different data formats (XML, JSON, etc.).**  
**Enables real-time data retrieval and processing.**  
**Enhances automation by reducing manual data input.**

## **Request Body and Response Handling in Web Service Invocation**

This section of the **Web Service Invocation** configuration allows users to send data to an API and define how the response should be handled.

---

## **Request Body**

- The **Request Body** field is used when sending data in HTTP methods like **POST, PUT, or PATCH**.
- This field remains **empty for GET requests** (since they only fetch data).
- The format of the request body depends on the **Content-Type**:
- **JSON** (application/json)

    ```json
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
    ```

- **XML** (application/xml)

```xml
    <user>
      <name>John Doe</name>
      <email>john@example.com</email>
    </user>
```

- **Form Data** (application/x-www-form-urlencoded)

```plaintext
    name=John+Doe&email=john@example.com
```

### **Use Cases for Request Body**

**Sending form data to a server**  
**Creating or updating database records**  
**Triggering actions in external APIs**  

---

## **Save Response**

- Defines how the response from the API should be handled.
- The **selected option** is:  
  **"Get text into variable (for web pages)"**, meaning the response data will be stored in a variable for later use.

### **Other Possible Response Handling Options**

- **Store JSON/XML Response** → If the response contains structured data, it can be parsed and processed.
- **Save File** → If the API returns a file (e.g., PDF, CSV, image), it can be downloaded and stored.
- **Trigger Next Action** → The response can be used to make decisions within the workflow.

### **Use Cases for Saving Responses**

**Extracting data from API responses**  
**Parsing and using JSON/XML data in workflows**  
**Saving files for future processing**  

---

## **API Response Output Configuration**

This section defines how the **web service response** is handled, specifying what data will be extracted and stored from the API request.

---

## **Output Fields**

### **WebServiceResponseHeader** (HTTP Headers)

- Stores the **headers** from the API response.
- Headers contain metadata such as:
  - **Content-Type** (e.g., JSON, XML, text)
  - **Date** (Timestamp of response)
  - **Server Information**
  - **Cache-Control** settings

**Use Case:** Useful for debugging, security checks, and response validation.

---

### **WebServiceResponseHeader** (Response Text)

- Stores the **actual response body** returned by the API.
- Depending on the API, this could be:

- **JSON Data**:

  ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "message": "Data retrieved successfully"
    }
  ```
- **XML Data**:

  ```xml
    <response>
      <status>success</status>
      <message>Data retrieved successfully</message>
    </response>
  ```

- **Plain Text**:

  ```
    Success: Data processed
  ```

**Use Case:** Essential for extracting meaningful data from API responses.

---

### **StatusCode** (HTTP Status Code)

- Captures the **status code** of the response.
- Common HTTP status codes:
  - **200 OK** → Success
  - **201 Created** → Resource created successfully
  - **400 Bad Request** → Invalid request
  - **401 Unauthorized** → Authentication failure
  - **500 Internal Server Error** → API-side issue

**Use Case:** Helps determine if the API request was successful or encountered an error.

---

## **Summary**

The **Invoke Web Service** node is an essential tool for API-based automation. It allows workflows to interact with external systems efficiently, making it ideal for real-time data processing, API integrations, and automated data exchange.

The **Request Body** allows users to send structured data, while the **Save Response** option defines how the retrieved data is stored and used. Together, they enable seamless communication with external web services, automating data exchange and workflow execution.

This configuration **enables full control** over API responses:

- **Headers** for metadata.
- **Response Text** for actual data.
- **Status Code** for request validation.

By enabling all three, you can effectively process, debug, and use API responses within your workflow.
