## Fields and Options

### **1. List Name**

### **2. Description**

- Below the name, there's a short description (e.g., *The new list*) to give context or additional info about the list.

### **3. Toggle Switch**

- Positioned on the right side.
- Enables or disables the list (or marks it active/inactive for some initial purpose).

## Use Cases

- Creating a list to store items dynamically during an automation run.
- Initializing list variables for iteration or condition-based logic.
