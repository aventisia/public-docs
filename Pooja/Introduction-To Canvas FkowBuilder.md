# FlowBuilder Canvas

The FlowBuilder canvas is the main workspace where you design and manage your workflows. It's a visually intuitive environment that allows you to drag-and-drop nodes, connect them with lines, and configure their properties.

## Canvas Elements

### Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of your workflows. Each node represents a specific action or operation that your workflow performs. You can add nodes to your canvas by clicking the "+" symbol or by dragging them from the side panel.

### Lines

Lines connect nodes together, defining the order in which they are executed. The direction of the line indicates the flow of your workflow. You can create a connection between two nodes by dragging a line from one node to another.

### Plus Symbol

The plus symbol is a handy tool that lets you quickly add new nodes to your workflow. You can click it to open a menu of available nodes, and then drag the desired node to the canvas.

## Workflow Design

The canvas is designed to guide you through the workflow design process. It provides you with a visual representation of your workflow, making it easier to understand and debug. You can add nodes to the canvas, rearrange them, and connect them as needed.

## Workflow Execution

Once you've designed your workflow, you can execute it by clicking the "Execute" button. This will run your workflow from start to finish, performing the actions defined by your nodes.

## Workflow Management

The canvas provides you with tools for managing your workflows, such as the ability to save them, load them, and share them with others.

## User Interface

The FlowBuilder canvas has a user-friendly interface that's easy to learn and use. The interface includes:

- **Top Bar:** Displays the FlowBuilder logo, the current workflow name and version, the browser's navigation buttons, and the "Verify it's you" icon.
- **Toolbar:** Contains the "Execute", "Logs", "PB", and other buttons for interacting with the workflow.
- **Side Panel:** Contains a menu for managing the workflow and accessing additional features.

## Example: Manual Trigger Node

The screenshot shows a workflow with a single node: a Manual Trigger. The Manual Trigger node is a starting point for workflows that are triggered manually.

The node's description is: **"Start your flow clicking the execute but..."**. This indicates that the workflow will only begin after you manually click the "Execute" button.
