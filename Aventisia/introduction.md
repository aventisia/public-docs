## What is Aventisia? 
Aventisia is a workflow automation platform for modern digital transformation teams.

Whether you run a B2B services company focused on digitally transforming your client processes, or automating your own processes, Aventisia will work for you.

We hope by the end of this course, youâ€™ll agree that it works very well.
